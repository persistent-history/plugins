#Plugin Priorities:

This is an organized Github repository for work on PersistentHistory. Plugins will be listed in seperate branches, and are to be submitted via pull requests.

Our following priorities are as follows. Plugins that have a higher difficulty will be done later. Plugins are in the following order and requirements are listed
in a bullet point fashion. Please be aware that some plugins needed to be developed are easier than others and will thus be worked on first by individuals, rather
than group entities as a whole.

Key:
- Neccessary.
* - Recommended.
& - Wanted, But Not Vital.

Plugins:
##- Character Cards (Easy)
	- Must be in-sync with the Calendar plugin API. An API for the Calendar plugin should also be theoretically developed.
	- Character Descriptions must be dynamic and in-sync with the characters age.
	- Random chances of a character dying will increase as the age gets higher, and child mortality rates may be factored in earlier in life to increase realism.
		- When a person dies, the person should be notified as well as it being a gradual process instead of a sudden process.
	- Disesases will also be applied to a person's character card, as well as a dynamic title.
##- Knowledge Trees (Individual)
	- To be a research skill tree, combat skills are not essential, but it should contain the following:
		- Mining
		- Woodcutting
		- Fishing
		- Digging
		- Building
		- Farming
		- And all other major civilian sectors at this time.
		* Ideally, make it a web, but prioritize making it a skill tree instead of a skill web. This may be re-evaluated later on.
